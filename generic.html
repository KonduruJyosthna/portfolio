									<h3 class="major">My childhood</h3>
									<p>I was born in Puttur, Ap. I was very active in my childhood who used to play all the time, go to neighbours house and do all the mischievious things. I've done my pre-schooling in Borabanda,Hyderabad and later on moved to Bangalore for Primary education. It was such a beautiful and lovely place filled with greenery all over. I was very active in schooling, sports and extra-curricular activites.Kho-kho and kabaddi are my favourite sports.  won many awards and certificates in sports and academics.
										Overall i was a merit student with lots of hopes and achievements in life.</p>

									<p>Then I completed my Secondary education, Intermediate and is pursuing B-Tech in Hyderabad. This place is opposite to Banglore in a few aspects like weather, humidity, pollution etc..I've been continuing with the same levels of merit in education but my interest in sports reduced slowly as we don't find grounds in most of the schools but i still play them in villages.    </p>
									<h3 class="major">Career Plans</h3>
									<p>As I had time to concentrate more on studies, a seed grew up in my mind to achieve something in my life which would make me independent. This B-Tech career is helping by pouring water in the form of new developments to grow into a tree. As we know there is a lot of gender discrimination throughout the globe, I'm very lucky to have parents who give me freedom to do great in life. Though I'm restricted by some rules to enjoy life, I still believe that once I make them smile through my achievement that would give me happiness, respect, freedom and what not. All this gets successful only after I work hard to become a reputed SOFTWARE ENGINEER.</p>
